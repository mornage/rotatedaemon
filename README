what is this?
=============

rotatedaemon is a C++ conversion (and enhancement) of a script called 'rotate.py' for Maemo (original author unknown).

Basically, it rotates applications - and not just landscape or portrait, reverse landscape/portrait are supported too.

It also supports a granular blacklist feature (to avoid rotating unstable applications), unlike rotate.py.

I was going to do a fair bit more with this, but really, there aren't many applications that work well in portrait mode.
